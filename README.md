# FaustMod

> ⚠️ **FaustMod is in its initial development phase.** Expect rough edges, breaking
> changes, and features that are still landing or being reworked. Not yet production-ready.

FaustMod offers a modular visual design environment to [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/)
(Functional Audio Stream), a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio
processing with a strong focus on the design of synthesizers, musical instruments, audio
effects, etc.

A browser-based **modular audio synthesis IDE**. Patch DSP components together on a
node canvas, hear the result live, write your own DSP in the built-in Faust editor, and
save/open patches. DSP is written in the [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/) language and
runs as WebAssembly AudioWorklets in the browser.

## Stack

- **React + Vite + TypeScript** — app shell and tooling
- **[rete.js v2](https://retejs.org/)** (React renderer) — the node editor
- **[@grame/faustwasm](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faustwasm)** — in-browser Faust → WASM AudioWorklet compiler
- **Web Audio API** — routing, mixing, stereo I/O

## Features

- **400+ built-in DSP blocks** (oscillators, filters, EQ, delays, reverbs, envelopes,
  dynamics, distortion, modulation, math, routing…), searchable palette.
- **Sequencing & pitch** — clock **divider**/**multiplier**, **Euclidean** sequencer
  (steps/pulses/rotation), **arpeggiators** (chord shapes clocked), and per-scale
  **quantizers** (major, minor, modes, pentatonic, blues, whole-tone, chromatic).
- **Mixing & modulation** — a **Mixer 4** (level/pan/send → L, R, aux), an 8→mono
  sub-mixer, a constant-power **Pan**, a **2×2 mod matrix**, an attenuverting **CV mixer**,
  and a morphing **Wavetable** oscillator.
- **Instrument/widget nodes** — oscilloscope (signal + trigger, resizable), spectrogram
  (resizable), analog VU meter, digital voltmeter, R/G/B/Y LEDs, and 8/16-step
  sequencers (drag for pitch, click to mute, shift-drag for velocity → frequency,
  gate and velocity outputs).
- **Control / playability** — on-screen **Keyboard** (mouse or A–K keys) and **MIDI In**
  (Web MIDI) outputting frequency + gate (+ velocity), a rotary **Knob**, an **XY Pad**
  macro, a **Comment** note, a **Clock (BPM)**, and an **Env VCA** (gate-driven ADSR).
- **Sample player** — load an audio file; a trigger plays it, with a rate/pitch control
  and stereo output.
- **Granular** — load a file and get a continuous windowed grain cloud with position,
  grain size, density, pitch and spray control inputs (scan/modulate them for textures).
- **User Defined DSP** — a right-hand palette of your own Faust modules. Create one with
  **+ New DSP**, edit it in a floating **CodeMirror editor** (Faust syntax highlighting,
  Compile to check, Save as a draft, or Done to apply), double-click to edit, rename/delete,
  and drag onto the canvas. A slider in your code (`hslider(...)`) *declares a control-input
  connector* (not an on-screen knob). Stored in `localStorage`. See *User Defined DSP* below.
- **Custom blocks (import)** — paste a self-describing block definition (Faust source +
  port metadata) via **Block → Import DSP Block…**; compiled in-browser and added to your
  DSP. See *Custom DSP blocks*.
- **Multiple tabs** — one patch per tab; only the active tab plays.
- **Recording + devices** — record the master output (Rec button → `.webm`, or a
  **Record** node driven from the patch); pick audio input/output devices (File → Settings).
- **File management** — a top menu (File / Edit / View / Block / Help) with New, Open,
  Save, Save As, Export, undo/redo, and the `.faustmod` patch format.
- **AI DSP authoring** — the New DSP editor has a **Make** button that generates Faust from
  a prompt via **your own OpenRouter key** (File → Settings). See *Using an external AI*.
- **Bring-your-own-AI** — or drive an external chat: **File → Export Catalog for AI…**
  gives it the formats + catalog to write whole patches. See *Using an external AI* below.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # type-check + production build
```

Drag a component from the left palette onto the canvas, drag between sockets to patch,
then **Start**. Use **+ New DSP** (right panel) to write your own Faust DSP, the **File**
menu to save/open `.faustmod` patches, **Block → Import DSP Block…** to import a Faust
block, and **File → Export Catalog for AI…** to drive an external AI.

### Building the block catalog

The DSP blocks are **precompiled at build time** into WASM factories. These artifacts —
`public/factories/` and `src/generated/catalog.json` — are **generated, not committed**
(they're in `.gitignore`), so a fresh clone must build them before the app can load any
blocks:

```bash
npm run catalog            # compile all blocks → public/factories/ + src/generated/catalog.json
npm run catalog -- --force # force a full rebuild (skips the up-to-date check)
```

You normally don't run this by hand — it's wired to run automatically:

- **`npm run dev`** → `predev` runs `npm run catalog`
- **`npm run build`** → `prebuild` runs `npm run catalog`

The step **skips when already fresh** (catalog newer than `scripts/blocks.mjs`), so it
only pays the compile cost when the block definitions change. Requires no external tools —
libfaust runs in Node via `@grame/faustwasm`. See
[Block catalog & precompiled factories](#block-catalog--precompiled-factories-scaling)
for how it works and how to add blocks.

## Architecture

The **audio engine** (`src/audio/`) is deliberately decoupled from the **editor**
(`src/editor/`):

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| `FaustService` | Loads precompiled block factories (`createFactoryNode`) with no compiler for the built-in library; also owns libfaust (`compile`) to build user-authored DSP at runtime. |
| `AudioEngine` | Owns the `AudioContext` and master gain → speakers. Created lazily on first user gesture. |
| `AudioGraph` | Holds the *desired* graph (nodes, connections, params). While "live", mirrors it into real Web Audio nodes. |
| `units.ts` | `FaustUnit` / `ConstantUnit` / `OutputUnit` / `InputUnit` — each exposes Faust channels as individual mono ports via `ChannelSplitter`/`ChannelMerger`. `FaustUnit` handles both kinds of control input: a `hslider`/`nentry` param binds to the worklet's **AudioParam**, and a plain signal input with a `default` is fed by an internal `ConstantSourceNode` until a connection detaches it. |

Each Faust component runs as **its own AudioWorklet** (instantiated from a precompiled
factory); a rete connection becomes a `splitter.connect(merger, srcCh, dstCh)` call. The editor pushes every change
(`nodecreated`, `connectioncreated`, param edits…) into `AudioGraph`, so playback stays
in sync with the canvas whether or not audio is currently running.

Component metadata (ports, defaults) is declared up front and loaded from the generated
`catalog.json`, so the editor knows each node's sockets and parameters instantly — no
compilation happens at startup (see below).

## Block catalog & precompiled factories (scaling)

The built-in library is **hundreds of DSP blocks**, and it must not slow startup.
So blocks are **precompiled at build time**, never in the browser:

- `scripts/blocks.mjs` declares candidate blocks as families of Faust functions.
- `npm run catalog` (run automatically by `prebuild`) compiles each one **once in
  Node** with libfaust, emits a tiny `public/factories/<id>.wasm` (~2 KB) + `<id>.json`
  per block, and writes `src/generated/catalog.json` with all the metadata. Blocks that
  fail to compile — or whose real I/O count doesn't match — are **pruned**, so the
  shipped catalog is always valid.
- At runtime the UI imports `catalog.json` (bundled, parsed instantly) and renders the
  palette. **No libfaust, no compilation at startup** — the UI is interactive immediately.
- A block's factory is fetched lazily (`FaustService.createFactoryNode`) only when a node
  of that type is first placed/played: `fetch` ~2 KB wasm → `WebAssembly.compile` → node.

libfaust (the ~3 MB compiler) is only loaded for *user-authored* DSP (the New DSP editor
and imported blocks), not for the built-in library.

To add blocks: extend the families in `scripts/blocks.mjs` and run `npm run catalog`.
The palette, audio graph, and AI all scale to the new count with no other changes.

## The node model: control inputs, not knobs

Nodes have **input ports and output ports only** — there are no inline parameter knobs.
Every parameter is an **audio-rate control input**. `process(freq, gain) = ...` declares
two control inputs; wiring a signal into one modulates that parameter sample-by-sample.

- An input with a `default` (e.g. `freq = 220`) is a **control input**. When nothing is
  connected, an internal `ConstantSourceNode(default)` drives it. Connecting a node
  detaches the default so the incoming signal takes over.
- An input without a default is a **signal input** (silent when unconnected).
- The **Constant** node is the only node with an editable value; it's how you set a
  specific frequency, cutoff, gain, etc. — wire `Constant(440) → freq`.

This means an LFO into a filter's `cutoff`, or an envelope into a VCA's `gain`, is just a
normal connection.

## Adding a component

Add an entry to `LIBRARY` in [`src/components/library.ts`](src/components/library.ts).
Declare the ports and write `process` so its control values are named signal inputs:

```ts
{
  id: "tremolo", title: "Tremolo", category: "Dynamics", kind: "faust",
  tooltip: "Amplitude modulation — periodic volume wobble.",   // node header tooltip
  inputs: [
    { label: "in", tooltip: "Signal to modulate." },           // signal input
    { label: "rate", default: 5, min: 0.1, max: 20, unit: "Hz", tooltip: "Wobble speed." },
    { label: "depth", default: 0.5, min: 0, max: 1, tooltip: "Wobble amount." },
  ],
  outputs: [{ label: "out", tooltip: "Modulated signal." }],
  code: `
import("stdfaust.lib");
process(x, rate, depth) = x * (1 - depth * (0.5 + 0.5 * os.osc(rate)));
`,
},
```

At startup every Faust component is compiled once and its actual input/output count is
checked against the declared ports (a mismatch logs a warning).

**Documenting ports:** the `tooltip` field on a component, an `InputSpec`, or an
`OutputSpec` is how you document what each node/port does. On hover, the node header and
each port show a tooltip combining your text with auto-generated facts (default value,
range, unit, whether it's a control or signal input). Nodes shrink-wrap their content, so
they vary in size and add ports without wasted space.

## Theme

The editor's dark 3D-metallic look (glowing category-accented headers, beveled node
bodies, pill controls, signal cables, line grid) lives in
[`src/editor/theme/`](src/editor/theme/) and is applied through rete-react-plugin's
`customize` hooks (`ThemedNode`, `ThemedSocket`) plus `theme.css`. Header accents are set
per category in [`accents.ts`](src/editor/theme/accents.ts).

## User Defined DSP

The right-hand **User Defined DSP** palette holds your own Faust modules (stored in
`localStorage`). **+ New DSP** creates one from a small template; double-click any entry to
open a floating **CodeMirror** editor (Faust syntax highlighting, standard shortcuts, and
**Cancel / Compile / Save / Done** — *Save* keeps a draft without compiling and flags it
with an amber dot; *Done* recompiles and applies). Rename (✎) and delete (×) inline, and
drag the entry onto the canvas.

Ports come straight from your code, read from the compiled Faust JSON (`derivePorts` in
`src/audio/faustIO.ts`): **audio channels become signal ports**, and a **UI param
(`hslider`/`nentry`/`button`) declares a named control-input connector** — with its default
and range — rather than an on-screen knob. At runtime the module compiles via libfaust and
is wrapped in the same `FaustUnit` as everything else, so a param control input binds to the
worklet's **AudioParam** (a wired signal drives it; unconnected, the declared default holds).

> Note: the built-in catalog blocks instead declare their control values as **named signal
> inputs** with metadata in `scripts/blocks.mjs`. A user module gets the same treatment via
> `hslider`, since the editor only has the code to work from. New to Faust? See the
> [Faust manual](https://faustdoc.grame.fr/manual/syntax/).

## Custom DSP blocks

**Block → Import DSP Block…** takes a self-describing block definition — Faust source plus
the port metadata the control-input model needs (labels + defaults). It's compiled
in-browser with libfaust to verify (and to read the I/O count), then added to your
**User Defined DSP** and persisted in `localStorage`:

```json
{
  "format": "faustmod-block",
  "title": "My Lowpass", "category": "Custom",
  "inputs": [ {"label":"in"}, {"label":"cutoff","default":1000,"min":20,"max":20000,"unit":"Hz"} ],
  "outputs": [ {"label":"out"} ],
  "code": "import(\"stdfaust.lib\"); process(x, cutoff) = x : fi.lowpass(2, cutoff);"
}
```

`process()` takes its control values as **named signal inputs in the same order as
`inputs`** (this is the audio-rate control-input model — see above). Custom blocks are
compiled at runtime; built-in blocks load precompiled factories.

## Patches & file format

Patches save as `.faustmod` (JSON): metadata, `nodes`, `connections`, and any **custom
blocks embedded** so a patch is self-contained. Save/Open use the File System Access API
(with download/upload fallback). See [`src/patch/format.ts`](src/patch/format.ts).

## Using AI

**In-app (DSP blocks):** the New DSP editor has a **Make** button. It sends your prompt (and
the current code) to **OpenRouter** with a small Faust/FaustMod coding-guidelines system prompt
and drops the generated program into the editor. It uses **your own OpenRouter key** (set it,
with the model, in **File → Settings**); the key stays in your browser and is sent only to
openrouter.ai, so FaustMod pays no tokens. No catalog/patch context is sent — the models already
know Faust; they just need the connector conventions.

**External chat (whole patches):** rather than pay per-token for a built-in LLM (which would need
the whole ~400-block catalog in context), **File → Export Catalog for AI…** downloads a
brief (the `.faustmod`/block file formats + the DSP-block catalog + the control/instrument
widget nodes) as a Markdown file. Give it to an external AI (e.g. as Project knowledge), ask
for a patch or a DSP block, and paste the result back via **Open** (patch) or
**Block → Import DSP Block…**.
Patches that use custom blocks are self-contained, so the AI can write those without any
catalog at all.

## Roadmap

Not built yet (rough priority):

- **Nested patches (patches-as-components)** — use a whole patch as a node inside another
  patch, with arbitrary embedding depth (à la Reaktor ensembles/macros). The key enabler
  for genuinely complex patches, and the planned next major step.
- **Polyphony** — voice allocation (Faust supports poly DSP); poly Keyboard/MIDI.
- **Global transport / master clock** — one BPM synced across sequencers; play/stop.
- **MIDI** — in/out, MIDI clock sync, MIDI CC → control node. Deferred to the very end;
  FaustMod is a patching/composition tool, not a real-time performance instrument.
- **Example patches** — a browser of bundled `.faustmod` demos (user-authored).
- **Recording** — WAV export (currently `.webm`), loop/overdub.
- **Sharing** — export/import patch links; a small gallery.

Copy/paste, duplicate, marquee selection and group-drag already work.

## Widget nodes

Instrument nodes (scope, meters, LEDs, sequencer…) are `kind: "widget"` components
(`src/components/widgets.ts`). Each realizes into a custom audio unit in
`src/audio/monitors.ts` (an AnalyserNode tap, or the sequencer's AudioWorklet) that
registers in a `Monitors` map keyed by node id. The matching React body in
`src/editor/widgets/` reads that map each frame to animate. Resizable widgets persist
their size (and the sequencer its notes) in the patch.
